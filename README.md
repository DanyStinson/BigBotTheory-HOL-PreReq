# BigBotTheory - Hands On Lab
## Create your first bot with Microsoft Botframework

### What do I need to start this lab?
#
#### Visual Studio 2015 
You may use [Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition](https://www.visualstudio.com/post-download-vs/?sku=community&clcid=0x409&telem=ga#) which is **Free**.

#### Bot Framework Template
To create our first bot we will use a template that Bot Framework provides to make things easier for us. 
You can download the [BotApplication.zip](https://download.botframework.com/bf-v3/builder/vstemplate/Bot%20Application.zip) from the official website or you can use the one I have uploaded in this repository directory.

**How do I install my Bot Template?**
Easy peasy. Once you have downloaded the .zip file, just paste it in the Visual Studio project templates directory.
This is the route you are looking for: 
**“%USERPROFILE%\Documents\Visual Studio 2015\Templates\ProjectTemplates\Visual C#\”**
After doing this you should be able to create a new **Bot Application** project 
#### Bot Framework Channel Emulator
Before we upload our Bot to the Cloud we should do some previous testing. For this, we have the  [Bot Framework Channel Emulator](https://docs.botframework.com/en-us/tools/bot-framework-emulator/). Download the emulator and install it in your computer. Later on I will guide you on how to use it.

**Once you have completed downloading and installing this three prerequisites you are ready to begin!**
**Enjoy!**
